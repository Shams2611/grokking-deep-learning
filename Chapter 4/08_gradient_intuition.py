# gradient intuition

# imagine error as a bowl
# we want to roll down to the bottom
# gradient tells us which way is down!

# gradient = slope at current point
# positive slope = go left (decrease weight)
# negative slope = go right (increase weight)

print("gradient = direction + steepness")
print()
print("steep slope = big gradient = big change needed")
print("flat slope = small gradient = small change needed")
print()
print("we always go OPPOSITE the gradient")
print("(going downhill on the error curve)")
