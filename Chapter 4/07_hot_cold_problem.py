# problem with hot/cold

# its slow! we try both directions each time
# and the step size is fixed

# what if we could know WHICH direction to go?
# and HOW MUCH to change?

# thats what GRADIENT DESCENT does!

print("hot/cold problems:")
print("  1. tries both directions (wasteful)")
print("  2. fixed step size (too big or too small)")
print("  3. no info about HOW wrong we are")
print()
print("solution: use the GRADIENT")
